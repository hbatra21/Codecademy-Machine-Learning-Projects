# Codecademy Machine Learning Projects
This repository contains completed projects from Codecademy's Supervised and Unsupervised Machine Learning Lessons.  
I also intend to add some personal projects.  
Always check this file as links it will be updated with links to the projects as and when they are added.

## Supervised Learning Projects
1. [**Linear Regression: Honey Production**](https://github.com/maryjonah/Coursera-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/1_Supervised%20Learning/Linear%20Regression_%20Honey%20Production.ipynb)  
   Fit a line to data about the honeybee population decline in the United States.
2. [**Multiple Linear Regression: Yelp Regression Project**](https://github.com/maryjonah/Coursera-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/1_Supervised%20Learning/yelp_regression-checkpoint.ipynb)  
   Use real data from Yelp to predict the Yelp rating of a restaurant.
3. [**K-Nearest Neighbor: Breast Cancer Classifier**](https://github.com/maryjonah/Codecademy-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/1_Supervised%20Learning/K-Nearest%20Neighbors_Breast%20Cancer%20Classifier.ipynb)  
   A K-Nearest Neighbor classifier that is trained to predict whether a patient has breast cancer.   
4. [**Logistic Regression: Predict Titanic Survival**](https://github.com/maryjonah/Codecademy-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/master/1_Supervised%20Learning/Logistic%20Regression_Predict%20Titanic%20Survival.ipynb)  
   A Logistic Regression model to predict whether an imaginary passenger who boarded the Titanis will survive or not.
